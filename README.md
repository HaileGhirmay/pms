This is a lab1 product management system app


PROJECT STATEMENT:
Assume that a National Groceries supply company has hired you to develop a Command-
Line Interface (CLI) application for their Products Management system, which they will be
using to manage data about the Products they supply.

TASKS TO BE DONE:
For this question, do the following:
1. Create a new Command-Line Interface application project.
2. In the project, implement code for the class named, Product, including each of the data
fields required by the specification above, add 3 constructors including the default
constructor, and getter (accessor) and setter (mutator) methods. Make the class be
inside a package/namespace named,
“edu.miu.cs.cs489appsd.lab1a.productmgmtapp.model”.
3. Add and code an executable class named, ProductMgmtApp, and in it include the main
method. And, in the main method, create an array of Products using the company’s
data, as given above. Also, implement a method named, printProducts, that takes as
input the array of products data and it prints them out to the console, sorted in
ascending order by the product name, in each of the following formats: JSON, XML and
CSV.
Make the ProductMgmtApp class be inside a package named,
“edu.miu.cs.cs489appsd.lab1a.productmgmtapp"

4. In the main method, add code to invoke your printProducts(…) method and execute
your program, take a screenshot of your IDE showing the output/result.
